# 🧠 pi-mempalace

**Your AI forgot everything again. How delightful.**

Every conversation you've ever had with an AI — every architectural decision, every late-night debugging eureka, every "let's use Postgres because..." — *poof*. Gone the moment you close the tab. Your AI has the long-term memory of a goldfish at a rave.

**pi-mempalace fixes that.** It gives [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) agents persistent, cross-session memory. Save important context, search it later, and stop re-explaining your life choices to a machine.

## 🧬 Fork & Credits

This repository is a **merge of two independent pi-native implementations** of the MemPalace concept, combining their strengths into a single, well-tested codebase:

| Source | Author | Contribution |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [🚀 **Jabbslad/pi-mempalace**](https://github.com/Jabbslad/pi-mempalace) | **Jamie Slade** | Original pi-native implementation — SQLite + sqlite-vec backend, auto-capture, knowledge graph, palace graph, agent diary, wake-up context, TUI stats overlay, and the 4-layer memory stack. This repo is forked from Jabbslad's work and retains his architectural foundation. |
| [🧠 **@sinamtz/pi-mempalace**](https://github.com/sinamtz/pi-mempalace) | **Sina Montazeri** | Ideas and code ported from this fork: paragraph-aware chunking with overlap, file directory mining (`.gitignore` awareness, binary detection, 30+ source extensions), conversation transcript import (Q+A exchange detection), auto-server SurrealDB pattern (evaluated and rejected in favor of SQLite for security/simplicity), and the layered retrieval protocol concepts. |
| [🏰 **MemPalace**](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace) | **Milla Jovovich & Ben Sigman** | The original palace metaphor (wings, rooms, tunnels), the verbatim-storage philosophy, the 4-layer retrieval stack, and LongMemEval benchmark validation. Both pi-native implementations are directly inspired by this project. |

**The current repository is co-authored by [Irving A. Bermúdez S.](https://github.com/chirvo)** — who forked Jabbslad's work, ported features from sinamtz's fork, and performed the security audit, modular refactor, TDD test suite, and issue triage documented below.

## 🏰 Standing on the Shoulders of a Memory Palace

This whole lineage traces back to the wonderful [MemPalace](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace) — built by **Milla Jovovich** (yes, *that* Milla Jovovich — Leeloo from *The Fifth Element*, Alice from *Resident Evil*) and developer **Ben Sigman**.

> **Official MemPalace sources:** [github.com/MemPalace/mempalace](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace), [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mempalace/), and [mempalaceofficial.com](https://mempalaceofficial.com). Avoid unofficial MemPalace domains.

Milla's origin story is painfully relatable: after thousands of conversations with AI, she realized every new session was a clean slate. All her decisions, reasoning, creative ideas — thrown into the void. Existing memory tools like Mem0 and Zep tried to help, but they had a fatal flaw: they used AI to decide what was worth remembering. The nuance, the "why," the reasoning behind decisions — exactly the stuff that matters — was the first to go.

So Milla and Ben spent months building MemPalace with Claude Code, and landed on a beautifully simple idea:

> **Don't let AI decide what to forget — store everything, then make it findable.**

Their MemPalace scored **96.6% R@5 on LongMemEval** in raw mode with zero API calls. Current MemPalace also reports stronger hybrid retrieval results, while its maintainers now avoid headline claims that mix retrieval recall with end-to-end QA accuracy.

pi-mempalace takes that core philosophy — **verbatim storage + semantic search** — and reimagines it as a native [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) extension. No Python. No ChromaDB. No pip install nightmares. Just pure TypeScript running in-process, fast enough to forget that forgetting was ever a problem.

## ✨ What It Does

- **🔄 Auto-capture** — Each Pi conversation exchange is stored automatically after each turn. Auto-captured exchanges are capped at 2,000 characters to keep storage cheap; manual saves can store longer content, which is chunked for search.
- **🌅 Wake-up context** — Each new session starts with a whisper of who you are and what you've been up to (~600-900 tokens of "previously on your life").
- **🔍 Semantic search** — Find past decisions by *meaning*, not keywords. "Why did we pick that database?" just works.
- **📁 Project-aware** — Memories are tagged by project (auto-detected from your directory) and topic. Auto-capture and untitled manual saves use local `flan-t5-small` for a durable topic label, falling back to `general` if inference is unavailable.
- **🏠 Local-first** — Storage, embeddings, search, and topic inference run in-process via HuggingFace models + SQLite. Topic inference never calls Pi's selected LLM and can be disabled with `/memory topics off`.
- **📊 Beautiful stats** — Sparkline activity charts, bar graphs by project/topic, and a TUI overlay that makes you feel like a hacker in a 90s movie.

## 🚀 Install

```bash
# Install from GitHub
pi install git:github.com/chirvo/pi-mempalace

# Or from a local checkout
pi install /path/to/pi-mempalace
```

That's it. `pi install` runs `npm install` automatically, which pulls in all three runtime dependencies:

| Dependency | What It Does | Native? |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `@huggingface/transformers` | Local embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) and topic labels (`flan-t5-small`) | No — pure JS, downloads models on first use |
| `better-sqlite3` | SQLite database access | Yes — compiles native addon via `node-gyp` |
| `sqlite-vec` | Vector similarity search for SQLite | Yes — ships prebuilt binary per platform |

No Python. No conda. No Docker. No ChromaDB server. Topic inference is local and does not use Pi model/auth; storage and search need no separate API keys. No sacrificial offerings to the dependency gods.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (required by pi)
- **C++ toolchain** for `better-sqlite3`'s native build:
  - macOS: `xcode-select --install`
  - Linux: `sudo apt install build-essential` (or equivalent)
  - Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools

Most dev machines already have this. If `pi install` fails with gyp errors, that's the fix.

## 🎮 Quick Start

```bash
# Set up your identity and verify everything works
/skill:memory-setup

# Explicitly save something important
memory_save("We chose PostgreSQL for concurrent write support", project: "myapp", topic: "database")

# Search later, when you've inevitably forgotten
memory_search("why did we pick the database?")

# Browse a project's collected wisdom
memory_recall(project: "myapp")

# Check on your growing brain
memory_status()
```

### Configuration

Config is stored at `~/.pi/agent/memory/config.json`:

```json
{
  "autoCapture": true,
  "wakeUpEnabled": true,
  "wakeUpMaxTokens": 800,
  "topicInferenceEnabled": true,
  "defaultProject": null
}
```

Local topic inference loads `Xenova/flan-t5-small` on first use when auto-capturing a turn or saving a memory without an explicit topic. It does not call Pi's selected LLM or any paid model API. Toggle it with `/memory topics on` or `/memory topics off`.

### ⚡ Performance

Benchmarked on Apple Silicon (M-series). Your mileage may vary, but it'll be fast.

| Operation | Time | Vibes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Model load (first store) | ~200ms | ☕ One-time cost per session |
| Store 1 memory (warm, explicit topic) | ~1ms | ⚡ Blink and you'll miss it |
| Infer topic (when enabled) | Local `flan-t5-small` call | 🏷️ Better rooms, no paid LLM call |
| Search 100 memories | ~1ms | 🚀 Faster than you can forget |
| Wakeup L0+L1 | <1ms | 🌅 Instant dawn |
| Recall L2 (filtered) | <1ms | 🎯 SQL indexes go brrr |
| Knowledge graph query | <1ms | 🧩 Basically free |
| Palace graph | <1ms | 🏰 All the tunnels, no waiting |

### 💾 Storage

Memories live in a SQLite database at `~/.pi/agent/memory/memories.db`, powered by [sqlite-vec](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec) for vector similarity search. Metadata is indexed (project, topic, timestamp) for fast pre-filtering before vector search kicks in. Deduplication via SHA-256 hash means you can't accidentally remember the same thing twice — unlike that embarrassing story you keep retelling at parties.

> **Migrating from v0.1?** If you have an existing `memories.jsonl` file, it's automatically migrated to SQLite on first load. Your old file is renamed to `.bak`. No data lost, no action needed.

## 🏰 MemPalace Concepts in pi-mempalace

The original [MemPalace](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace) uses a richer architecture — **Wings** (top-level containers), **Rooms** (topics), **Halls** (corridors by memory type), **Closets** (searchable pointer layers), and **Drawers** (verbatim source files). It runs on Python with ChromaDB by default and includes AAAK, an experimental lossy compression dialect.

pi-mempalace implements a Pi-native subset of those ideas in TypeScript:

| MemPalace Concept | pi-mempalace Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Wings** (projects/people) | `project` field — auto-detected from git repo |
| **Rooms** (topics within wings) | `topic` field — explicit or inferred locally with `flan-t5-small` |
| **Drawers** (verbatim chunks) | 800-char chunks with 100-char overlap, each with its own embedding |
| **Tunnels** (cross-wing connections) | `memory_graph` discovers shared topics across projects |
| **4-Layer Stack** | L0 Identity → L1 Essential Story → L2 On-Demand → L3 Deep Search |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Temporal triples with `valid_from`/`valid_to` — "what was true when?" |
| **ChromaDB** | SQLite + [sqlite-vec](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec) — local vector search, no Python |

This plugin deliberately skips several current MemPalace features: AAAK compression, closets, file/conversation mining, source adapters, hook management, repair/migration tools, and hybrid BM25 reranking.

The soul is the same: **your AI should remember you.**

If you want the full palace experience with all its wings, halls, closets, drawers, importers, and repair tooling, use the official [MemPalace project](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace). Milla and Ben built something special.

## 📊 Benchmark Validation

We reproduce [LongMemEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813) raw retrieval to validate this plugin's local semantic search. The benchmark stores 500 questions, each with ~50 timestamped conversation sessions, and measures whether the correct session appears in the top-K search results.

### Results (Raw Mode — Zero API, Fully Local)

| Metric | pi-mempalace | MemPalace (reference) | Delta |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Recall@5** | **95.8%** (479/500) | 96.6% (483/500) | -0.8pp |
| **Recall@10** | **98.2%** (491/500) | 98.2% (491/500) | **identical** |
| **NDCG@10** | **0.884** | 0.889 | -0.005 |

### Per Question Type

| Question Type | R@5 | R@10 | Questions |
|--------------|-----|------|-----------|
| knowledge-update | 🟢 100% | 100% | 78 |
| multi-session | 🟢 97.7% | 98.5% | 133 |
| temporal-reasoning | 🟡 94.7% | 99.2% | 133 |
| single-session-assistant | 🟡 94.6% | 96.4% | 56 |
| single-session-user | 🟡 92.9% | 95.7% | 70 |
| single-session-preference | 🟡 90.0% | 96.7% | 30 |

The 0.8pp R@5 gap comes from our 800-char chunking and differences between sqlite-vec and ChromaDB retrieval. The weakest categories (temporal, preference) are exactly what current MemPalace hybrid modes address with keyword re-ranking and temporal boosting — features this plugin has not implemented.

### Run It Yourself

```bash
# Download the LongMemEval dataset (~277MB)
curl -fsSL -o benchmarks/data/longmemeval_s_cleaned.json \
  https://huggingface.co/datasets/xiaowu0162/longmemeval-cleaned/resolve/main/longmemeval_s_cleaned.json

# Run full benchmark (500 questions, ~4 minutes)
npx tsx benchmarks/longmemeval_bench.mjs

# Quick smoke test (10 questions, ~5 seconds)
npx tsx benchmarks/longmemeval_bench.mjs --limit 10

# Save per-question results
npx tsx benchmarks/longmemeval_bench.mjs --out benchmarks/results/raw_500.jsonl
```

## 🤔 Why Not Just Use MemPalace Directly?

You absolutely could! MemPalace is great. But if you're already living in the pi ecosystem:

- **No Python required** — pi-mempalace is pure TypeScript, runs in-process
- **Pi-native MemPalace-inspired subset** — 4-layer wake-up/search model, chunking, palace graph, knowledge graph
- **SQLite instead of ChromaDB** — one file, no server, native Node.js via better-sqlite3
- **Palace graph with tunnels** — discover cross-project connections via shared topics
- **Temporal knowledge graph** — structured facts with time validity ("what was true when?")
- **Auto-chunking** — long content split into 800-char chunks with overlap, just like MemPalace
- **Native pi integration** — hooks into pi's extension system, session lifecycle, and TUI
- **Auto-capture built in** — short Pi exchanges are captured automatically; use `memory_save` for explicit durable notes
- **Wake-up context** — L0 identity + L1 essential story, injected before you even ask
- **Zero config** — install it and go. Topic labels use local `flan-t5-small` by default, or `/memory topics off` to keep auto-captures in `general`.
